# FirstNN
First Neural Network with the iris dataset (No Libraries except numpy)

## Requirements
* Python 3.x+
* Numpy

### Installation
```
pip install numpy
```
```
git clone https://github.com/willryan1/FirstNN.git
```
## Overview
Neural Network to ensure my knowledge on backpropegation is good

Used UCI Machine Learning repository however I only took 100 of the instances to make my output be -1 or 1. Made it easier for me to use the tanh activation function.

## Features

1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 

### Output

1. Iris Setosa - -1
2. Iris Versicolour - 1

### To Update Later
1. commenting
2. add third attribute (maybe use cross entropy)

Notes:
1. Created 2 years ago when I was a junior in highschool (its not very good)
2. Did the same thing in java but I can't find it on my computer :(
3. Used youtube videos such as 3Blue1Brown's videos on Neural Networks
4. Commenting
